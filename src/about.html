							<p class="section-excerpt grey">A Brief History</p>
							<p>Established in 1985 as Lambda Horizon, HokiePRIDE has undergone many transformations. During the early 1990's the organization changed its name to LGBT and later to LGBTA. In 1998, the organization became a University Chartered Student Organization (UCSO) and began the Safe Zone program. Safe Zone was a collaborative effort between the Dean of Students office, the LGBTA, the LGBT Caucus, and the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action. In Fall 2014, the LGBTA became known as HokiePRIDE of Virginia Tech. Today, the organization's main focus is programmatic, not political.</p>
							<p>As an organization that works to increase its social justice efforts, HokiePRIDE's current board wants to honor its past as an organization that was not inclusive enough for some members, while making every effort to provide one that is fully inclusive of all LGBTQ+ identities.
