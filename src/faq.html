								What does LBGT mean?
							</a> </h4>
									<div id="faq-collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
										<div class="panel-content"> LGBT stands for “lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.”  While these terms have increasing global resonance, in different cultures other customary terms may be used to describe people with genders and sexualities formed outside western frameworks.  This acronym is not all-inclusive, as it dates back several decades.  In recent years, easier to use terms like queer and GSRM (Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities) have become increasingly common.  </div>

								What’s the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity?
							</a> </h4>
									<div id="faq-collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
										<div class="panel-content"> Sexuality and gender are deeply tied into one another but they are separate things. Sexual orientation refers to  individuals’ attractions to others–who they love and date, and to whom they are physically and/or emotionally attracted. The terms lesbian, gay, and bisexual refer to one’s sexual orientation. Gender identity refers to individuals’ internal and individual experiences of gender. The term transgender refers to one’s gender identity. In basic terms, gender identity is concerned with who one is, and sexual orientation is concerned with who one loves. </div>
