                  <p>In 2018, HokiePRIDE had conversations with Student Affairs, the LGBT Faculty & Staff Caucus, and Housing & Residence Life to discuss changes Virginia Tech needed to make.</p>
                  <p>One of those changes was the need for gender inclusive housing. Thanks to some special friends in Housing, this initiative was quickly implemented for the 2019-2020 housing contract season. We hope this housing option will be of benefit to you!
                  <p>For more information, please visit the <a href="https://www.housing.vt.edu/contracts/apply/GenderInclusiveHousing.html" target="_blank">GIH page</a> on HRL's website.</h4>

                  <p>HokiePRIDE stands in solidarity with the Black community.  We are outraged by the recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, David McAtee, Tony McDade, and countless others.  We demand that justice be served and that the police officers be held accountable for their actions.</p>
                  <p>The history of the LGBTQ+ rights movement is fundamentally tied to the Black community.  Many people forget that trans and queer Black women started the Stonewall Riots in 1969, in response to police brutality towards the queer community, and was the start of LGBTQ+ liberation in this country.</p>
                  <p>Our leadership board recommends visiting <a href="blacklivesmatters.carrd.co">blacklivesmatters.carrd.co</a> for resources on where you can donate and petitions you can sign.  We have also attached a few other resources for those who want to speak out against injustice safely.  Feel free to share these resources with your friends and family.</p>
                  <p>Black lives matter to HokiePRIDE, and they always will.  We are renewing our commitment to uplifting the voices of our Black siblings.  Our organization will continue to work with groups like Queer and Trans People of Color (QTPOC) and the Cultural and Community Centers (CCCs) at Virginia Tech to cultivate a culture of mutual respect and trust within our community.<\p>
                  <p>We encourage members of our community to educate themselves, spend some time being introspective, and to think about what could be done to make this country a better place.  Call out racism where you see it, especially within our own community.</p>
                  <p>As Marsha P. Johnson said, “There is no pride for some of us without liberation for all of us.”</p>
