                  <p>In 2018, HokiePRIDE had conversations with Student Affairs, the LGBT Faculty & Staff Caucus, and Housing & Residence Life to discuss changes Virginia Tech needed to make.</p>
                  <p>One of those changes was the need for gender inclusive housing. Thanks to some special friends in Housing, this initiative was quickly implemented for the 2019-2020 housing contract season. We hope this housing option will be of benefit to you!
                  <p>For more information, please visit the <a href="https://www.housing.vt.edu/contracts/apply/GenderInclusiveHousing.html" target="_blank">GIH page</a> on HRL's website.</h4>
